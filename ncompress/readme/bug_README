* ncompress-4.2.4
program description:
---------------------
(Red Hat Linux util) compression and decompression program:
compress <filename>	(filename.Z is generated)
compress -d <filename>


bug explanation:
--------------------
Stack array overflow bug
compress42.c(line 896) in function comprexx(char **fileptr)
             char  tempname[MAXPATHLEN];
	     strcpy(tempname,*fileptr); 
	     
   Fileptr is pointing to the filename in input argument.
   Long input filename would cause tempname overflow.

   Since tempname is a (static) stack array, overflowing it
   may cause stack return address overwritten.

bug triggering input:
---------------------
Input in script/run-bug can cause application crash with core dump.
However, with input files with different length, there are different symptom:
no failure, infinite loop, segmentation fault, etc.

correct inputs:
--------------------
The input files in input/ folder are copied from SPEC95 164.gzip

bug detection preliminary results:
--------------------
purify and valgrind (the version I used) can not catch the bug, if there is
  no crash, even if the array is overflowed. They will report: jump to invalid 
  address, when system crashes, which is not very useful. 
ccured can point out the root cause.
