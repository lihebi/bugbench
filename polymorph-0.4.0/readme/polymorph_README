  i. what is polymorph?

     Specifically, polymorph is a filesystem "unixizer".
There are a number of places you can encounter files whose
names are affected by passing through a Microsoft system.
This program eliminates upper case letters from the
filename, and clears up the leading directory some
newsreaders (MS Outlook!) leave on the beginnings of files.

---------------------------

 ii. options

 command line switches:

 -a  all      convert all files, including hidden files
 -c  clean    trim filename after the last backslash '\'
 -f  filename convert 'filename' only
 -h  help     print a list of the recognized command line
                switches and exit
 -v  version  print the version of polymorph and exit
 -t  track    track symlinks and change the name of the
                target file

---------------------------

iii. why?

     This program came about after trying to collect
binaries from newsgroups for a little while.  All the files
I'd collected had these mucho-funky names like
collision_WAVE.MPG, or C:\ProNews\baffle.JPG.

     Obviously, this had to stop.

     I tried to write a short bash-script to get the job
done, but couldn't seem to get the shell to understand what
I meant by a "string".  So I wrote this program.  It does
what I want it to, and with a set of useful command line
switches, it's a little smarter than I could make a shell
script anyway.

     polymorph will look through the current directory and
rename files to their current name with all lower case
letters.  polymorph can also be told to just work on symlinks,
and leave their target files alone.  polymorph ignores
directories, and does not recurse directories (at this time).
If polymorph finds that the target name already exists, it will
skip renaming the original file.
